TODO
    fix python 3 deprecation warnings
    replace mute strings requirement on fretfinder with new ignore functionality

    Minor
        click track with argument controlled bpm
        pass in argument to set volume of audio playback (will later tie into GUI fader, so it needs to be done anyway)
        positive feedback noise on chord correct
        audible callout of chord and and shape (going from looking at frets to looking at screen is burning time)
        hit/miss report at end of session
        save data to file and print historic analysis (performance now v last session, v historic, total time working each level, etc). Saved to file based on input arg
    Major
        Multiple chords + shapes
            Look up common chord progressions, choose from a list.  One at a time is ok, but I need a full chord sheet to make this useful
        GUI!!  We're getting close to this being a necessity

Phase 1: fret identification
Phase 2: chord shaping
Phase 3: GUI
Phase 4: Distribution!
