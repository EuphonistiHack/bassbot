        Chords for bars:
            GUI arguments for how many bars each chord will be played for
            "Free play" chord exercise. Arpeggio by default, scale mode optional
            ChordExercise class implements chordTimeout
                TODO: who controls timer schedule for next chord?  Should exercise class instantiate and own its own timer?
                Once a note is played (evaluateNote returns true), QTimer starts
                Qtimer registers exercise class' chordTimeout function as handler
                chordTimeout procedes to next chord on list, returns True when list is empty


        Multiple chords + shapes
            Look up common chord progressions, choose from a list.  One at a time is ok, but I need a full chord sheet to make this useful

Phase 1: fret identification
Phase 2: chord shaping
Phase 3: GUI
Phase 4: Distribution!
